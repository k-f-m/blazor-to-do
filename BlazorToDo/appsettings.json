/*
 * This is a JSON configuration file that contains settings for a .NET application.
 *
 * The ConnectionStrings section contains a connection string that is used to connect to a local SQL Server database.
 *
 * The Logging section contains configuration settings for logging, including the default log level and the log level
 * for Microsoft.AspNetCore.
 *
 * The LogLevel property is set to Information by default, which logs all messages with a severity level of
 * Information or higher.
 *
 * The Microsoft.AspNetCore log level is set to Warning, which logs only messages with a severity level of
 * Warning or higher for that category.
 *
 * The AllowedHosts property in the JSON configuration file specifies which hosts are allowed to access the application.
 * In this case, the value is set to *, which can be a security risk as it allows anyone to access the application.
 * Itâ€™s recommended to specify a list of allowed hosts instead of using the * wildcard.
